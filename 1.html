An electronic cigarette is an electronic device that simulates tobacco smoking.
<p style="margin-top:1px;">It consists of an atomizer, a power source such as a battery, and a container such as a cartridge or tank.</p> Instead of smoke, the user inhales vapor. As such, using an e-cigarette is often called "vaping".
The atomizer is a heating element that atomizes a liquid solution called e-liquid. E-cigarettes are activated by taking a puff or pressing a button.
Some look like traditional cigarettes, and most versions are reusable.
Nicotine is toxic and highly addictive.
Young people are particularly susceptible to this, and most (90%) smokers start before the age of 18. Among first-time users 32% of people who try nicotine become addicted.
People who vape are more likely to start smoking.[15] For smokers who are unable or unwilling to quit using conventional smoking cessation methods such as NRT, vaping has a role in tobacco harm reduction.
